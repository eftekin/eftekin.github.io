# eftekin.github.io

This repository contains the source code for my personal website and portfolio. The website showcases my skills, experience, and projects while also providing a way to get in touch with me. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is forked from the [codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio) project. I've customized and simplified it to perfectly match my preferences and style.
